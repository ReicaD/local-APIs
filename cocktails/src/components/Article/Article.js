        Imagine a cocktail you know how to pour without referencing a book or
        the internet. A cocktail that uses ingredients already stocked in your
        bar — backup bottles at the ready. A cocktail you shake with ease
        whether you’re alone at the end of a long day or when you’re looking to
        impress someone on a third date. This venerable, default drink has a
        name: the house cocktail.
